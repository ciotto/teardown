# Reverse the Haier T32X robot 
###(Work in Progress)

I'm trying to reverse engineering the **Haier T325** Cleaning Robot.

Probably this robot is produced by *ILife* and is very similar to the **ILife V1** and to the **Ariete 2711**.

First of all I opened the plastic shell and I inspected the PCB:

![Haier T325](images/haier-t325.jpg)

After the inspection, I found the MCU, it is an [STM32F103](https://www.st.com/resource/en/datasheet/cd00161566.pdf) VBT6 in LQFP100 package, unfortunatly, the MCU is under the screen/touch panel. I don't have any experiences with this MCU, but after Googling I founded a lot of information and seems very commons. There are also many [prototype boards](https://it.aliexpress.com/item/1-pices-STM32F103C8T6-BRACCIO-STM32-Minimi-di-Sistema-Scheda-di-Sviluppo-Modulo-di-Rilevamento-di-Valutazione/32883012819.html?spm=a2g0s.13010208.99999999.275.71fe3c00kLsRht).

[Wikipadia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STM32#STM32_L1) help me to get some information about the STM32:

`STM32 F1 03 V B T6`

`STM32 xx ww y z`

  - xx - Family
  - ww - subtype: differs in equipment of peripherals and this depend on certain family
  - y - Package pin count
  - z - FLASH memory size
 
So, the F1 family use a CortexM3 core with 192kB flash.

In the datasheet I have find the pinout schema and some interesting pins:

Pin | Port
----|------
37 | PB2 / **BOOT1**
37 | PB2 / **BOOT1**
67 | PA8 / **USART1_CK** / TIM1_CH1/MCO
68 | PA9 / **USART1_TX** / TIM1_CH2
69 | PA10 / **USART1_RX** / TIM1_CH3
70 | PA11 / **USART1_CTS** / CANRX / USBDM / TIM1_CH4
71 | PA12 / **USART1_RTS** / CANTX / USBDP / TIM1_ETR
72 | PA13 / **JTMS** / **SWDIO**
76 | PA14 / **JTCK** / **SWCLK**
77 | PA15 / **JTDI**
89 | PB3 / **JTDO** / TRACESWO
94 | **BOOT0**

![STM32F103 in LQFP100](images/LQFP100.jpg)

In the STM32F10xxx, 3 different boot modes can be selected through BOOT[1:0] pins:

![PCB bottom](images/boot.jpg)

In order to ease the work, I dismounted the PCB from the robot and I found that in the bottom of the board the manufacturer had made a lot of test connection pads:

![PCB bottom](images/bottom.jpg)

The unsoldered jumpers JP1 and JP2 seems interesting.

So, first of all, I wanted to find GND and VDD pins on the STM32F103. GND reference was easy to find on switch or battery connection, but for VDD I must finded the 3V3 regulator, so I checked all main components of the board and I have searched their datasheet on internet:

4 | SUF2001 | [30V Dual N- and P-channel Trench MOSFET](http://www.kodenshi-tk.co.jp/products/power_semi_device/pdf/mosfet_03/03-10_SUF2001.pdf)

![PCB top](images/top.jpg)

With all the data, I started to investigate the MCU and I checked the accessible GND and VDD pins, but something's not right, the ground position doesn't match the datasheet pinout but, probably, the text over the chip are only tourned of 90°.

I must inspect all pins and, for this purpose, I have unsoldered the control panel. I don't have a lot of experience in unsoldering and I have damaged the pads, but, after this operation, I have access to all pins of the MCU and I have confirmed my hypothesis:

![STM32F103 in LQFP100](images/STM32F103_LQFP100.jpg)

At this time, I took sufficient data to find the SWD, USART1 and BOOT pins over the board. This operation can be done using a multimeter and a lot of patience. Following the tracks of the PCB we can have an idea of the connections and then we can check it with the multimeter short circuit test. Be careful that the PCBs can have many layers (usually 2, top and bottom) and that layers can be connected by VIAs (vertical interconnect access). Tracks and VIAs can be placed under other components.

Jumper | Pin 1 | Pin 2 | Pin 3 | Pin 4
-------|-------|-------|-------|-------
**JP1** | VDD | TX | RX | GND
**JP2** | VDD | GDN | *SWDIO* | *SWCLK*

![STM32F103 in LQFP100](images/schematic.jpg)

Good, when I have find all I need, I solder some cables for JP1, JP2, BOOT0 and BOOT1. I soldered also the missing R144 resistor (*10k*) in order to make a boot selector:

![PCB top](images/top-final.jpg)

## Ready to test SWD!

I done some tests using the *BusPirate* w/o succes, but with 9.99€ I can buy an *ST-Link V2* for the day after on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.it/gp/product/B077Z1T3LP/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1). I connected JP2 to the ST-link and ST-Link to may Mac.

### st-link

I have installed the ST-Link utilities and run `st-info --probe`:

```
> st-info --probe                                                                                                                                            ~/Documents/Ciotto/Haier-T32X@MBP-18.local

```

**BOOM!!** It works!

```

```

The device was recognised but, unfortunately, when I tried to dump the firmware, the image file was empty.

This probably means that the MCU have some type of protection enabled.

#### Disable Debug

When debug is disabled still possible to dump the firmware and, after this, we can modify it and reflash, unfortunately this does not seem to be my problem because I can't dump the firmware.

#### Read Out protection

STM32 support 3 protection levels:

  - **Level 0**: no read protection

    This essentially means that there aren't protection, but can still that Disable Debug was enabled.

  - **Level 1**: memory read protection enabled
    
    If a debug access is detected or boot is not set to flash memory area a system fault is generated. Mass-erase is allowed.
    
  - **Level 2**: memory read protection enabled and all debug features disabled.

    All protections provided by *Level 1*, but JTAG/SWD are disabled and chip can't be resetted.

Probably the Read Out protection is setted to *Level 1* because i can use SWD but I can't dump the firmware. In ther [PentestHardware](https://github.com/unprovable/PentestHardware) manual there are some usefull ideas for bypass this protection, but for now i try to inspect the **UART**.

### openocd

I also tried using **OpenOCD**, first of all I runned the server:

```

And, in other terminal, I opened a connection using telnet:

```

Is also possible to use GDB:

## Check the UART

Unfortunately I get poor results with the **SWD** interface, so I start to inspect the **UART**.

I attached my USB-to-Serial interface, I runned miniterm with most used baud rate and I reboot the board:

```
> python -m serial.tools.miniterm /dev/tty.usbserial-A50285BI 115200
--- Miniterm on /dev/tty.usbserial-A50285BI  115200,8,N,1 ---

```

Well, something happened. After some try with other common used baud rate, I got the out put:

```
> python -m serial.tools.miniterm /dev/tty.usbserial-A50285BI 57600
--- Miniterm on /dev/tty.usbserial-A50285BI  57600,8,N,1 ---
--- Quit: Ctrl+] | Menu: Ctrl+T | Help: Ctrl+T followed by Ctrl+H ---

BaseLineCurrent = 0122
Battery Voltage = 1596
```

Good, this is the confirmation that this robot is produced by *ILife*.

When I tried to start the board with BOOT0 to 3V3 there was no output, so probably this confirm that the **Read Out protection** is setted to *Level 1* or *Level 2*.

When I attached the charger, the robot logged ` Charge Start` over serial, but when I press buttons over IR remote or send command with the UART, nothing is happening.

## Try to bypass the Readout Protection

The Master (aka [Gipi](https://github.com/gipi)) shared with me a link about [dumping ARM Cortex-M0 firmware](http://blog.includesecurity.com/2015/11/NordicSemi-ARM-SoC-Firmware-dumping-technique.html) through the MCU's registers, the STM32 F1 subserie use a ARM Cortex-M3 core but in theory can work.

The idea is to use the debugger in order to single-step the execution of code, I can't see the code, but code must to be executed and some operation require to read the memory into a register.

Find this operation require some try, we can set all the registers to 0x0, do some a step until a register change and retry this line with all the registers set to 0x4. If the value in the register is different and the delta is not 4, we probably finded an operation tha read the memory. The confirm can be reached using this command to read itself and than we can disassembles it. 

So, let's try to single-step the code execution:

```

```

Ok, well but not very well, I can do reset and halt, I can read registers but when I do a single-step the execution fall in Handler HardFault.

However, I tried to write a [Python script](scripts/firmware_dump.py) that automatically search a valid operation. This script set PC register to a specific address, reset general purpose registers and single-step the operation, after this check the changes on the registers.

```
> python scripts/firmware_dump.py search -a 0x0800018c
Search command..
Try with address 0x8000250
Skip sum operation
Try with address 0x800025a
Skip sum operation
...
Try with address 0x8009138
Skip sum operation
Try with address 0x805289e
```

I run my script from the reset address but after a lot of time I found nothing, so probably this solution doesn't work in my case.
